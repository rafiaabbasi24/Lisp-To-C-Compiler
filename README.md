# Lisp-To-C-Compiler

# Overview
The “LISP to C Compiler” project is aimed at building a compiler that translates LISP programs into 
syntactically correct and semantically equivalent C programs. This tool is useful for understanding 
compilation processes, bridging paradigms, and allowing execution of functional code in a procedural 
runtime. It includes stages such as lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, and code generation, 
producing C code that maintains the logic and behavior of the original LISP source.

The compiler is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lexical and syntax analysis are implemented 
using JavaScript-based parsing logic. The LISP code is parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which 
is then traversed to generate equivalent C code.The entire compiler is modular, with clearly 
separated components for each phase—making it easy to debug, test, and extend further.
